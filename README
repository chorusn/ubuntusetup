make sure you already installed firefox and thunderbird snap already before running de.sh and i expect you
to already install the nala package, git and also optional snap-store

install commands
  "snap install firefox" && "snap install thunderbird" && "snap install snap-store"
and also if you found the flatpak "note that directories (void) is not on path" here's the fix

1.nano ~/.bashrc
2. add to .bashrc this
   export XDG_DATA_DIRS=$XDG_DATA_DIRS:/var/lib/flatpak/exports/share:/home/$USER/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share
3.source ~/.bashrc
